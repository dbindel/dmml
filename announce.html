http://www.dbindel.net/dmml/index.html

UC Berkeley, Oct 3-4, 2025
Registration deadline: Sep 1.

This workshop is dedicated to James Demmel for his leadership in
modern high-accuracy and high-performance linear algebra solvers
and for his promotion of numerical linear algebra to a broad
audience through software, teaching, and collaboration. Workshop
themes include:

- Linear algebra software design
- Scalable communication-avoiding methods
- High-performance and auto-tuning
- High-accuracy computations and error analysis
- Application-inspired methods
- Connections between numerical linear algebra and other areas of mathematics
- Promotion of numerical linear algebra through teaching and exposition
