# JWD70 workshop site

The current site style is built on [Pure][pure], a small set of
responsive CSS modules from Yahoo.  In this setting, "responsive"
means that the site should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes
and window sizes.  The new design hues closely to Pure's
[side menu layout example][side], and I have in no way modified the
default CSS behavior from the Pure framework.

For content management, I am using [Jekyll][jekyll] a plain-text
static site generator.  Jekyll may be the most popular of the
available static site generators, in part because it is used in
[Github Pages][ghpages].  The chief goal of using Jekyll is to
separate the content from presentation, making it simpler to apply
general stylistic changes in the future.
