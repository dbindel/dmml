  Numerical linear algebra has a broad and lively research frontier.
  New applications demand ever-greater scalability and accuracy, and
  evolutions in computer architecture require fundamentally new
  approaches to optimize performance on current and future machines.
  Prompted by these challenges, experts in the field are exploring new
  ways to use matrix structure, algorithms with efficient computation
  and communication patterns, and methods to automatically optimize
  implementations for high performance.  Research in the area
  continues to have impact that is widely felt across many areas of
  science and engineering, largely because of a tradition of robust
  software design and exposition for broad audience.

  This workshop is dedicated to James Demmel for his leadership in
  modern high-accuracy and high-performance linear algebra solvers and
  for his promotion of numerical linear algebra to a broad audience
  through software, teaching, and collaboration.  Workshop themes
  include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Linear algebra software design</li>
  <li>Scalable communication-avoiding methods</li>
  <li>High-performance and auto-tuning</li>
